                “60% of data breaches are caused by a failure to patch. If you correct that, you’ve eliminated 60% of breaches. And I didn’t even have to say AI or Blockchain! See how that works?” - Ricardo Lafosse

            <blockquote>
                “The only secure computer is one that’s unplugged, locked in a safe, and buried 20 feet under the ground.”<br>
                — Frank Abagnale
